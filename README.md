# Platform-science-test

### Usage

1. Create two text data files, one with the list of driver names, and the other with the list of destination addresses. Each line of the drivers file should have a single driver name. Similarly, each line of the destinations file should have a single destination address. Recall that this will be a balanced assignment, so there should be the same number of drivers as there are destinations.

2. Start the application by running/typing '`npm run start`' from within the project directory (i.e. '`platform-science`').

3. The application will prompt the user to enter the filepaths to the data files created in step 1 above:

   1. `? Enter the path to the destinations list file` :

   - Type/enter the path (e.g. `test/data/destinations.txt`)

   2. `? Enter the path to the drivers list file` :

   - Type/enter the path (e.g. `test/data/drivers.txt`)
